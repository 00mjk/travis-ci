- add data migrations
- port commits from staging
- calculate build duration from matrix.sum(&:duration) or similar
- move actions from builds_controller to tasks_controller and use routes to keep the /builds url

def self.up
  migrate_table :builds, :to => :tasks |t|
    t.condition => 'parent_id IS NULL'
    t.move :number
    t.copy :all, :except => :foo
    t.exec 'UPDATE foo ...'
  end
end


- later: make payload instances Hashrs and rewrite lib/github

# Api changes
