- the worker doesn't seem to notify about task:configure:started
- fix n+1 queries: https://gist.github.com/058e40dc43b3eb5ac64c

- port commits from staging
- double check with Joel Mahoney on ported cbfc4f37
- calculate build duration from matrix.sum(&:duration) or similar

def self.up
  migrate_table :builds, :to => :tasks |t|
    t.condition => 'parent_id IS NULL'
    t.move :number
    t.copy :all, :except => :foo
    t.exec 'UPDATE foo ...'
  end
end


- later: make payload instances Hashrs and rewrite lib/github

# Api changes

- client: use task route for looking up child builds
- client: for configure jobs show "?" instead of a build number
- config: change queues configuration section
